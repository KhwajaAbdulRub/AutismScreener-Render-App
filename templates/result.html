                <h5>Precautions to Take</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Create a Predictable Routine</strong>: Children with change resistance benefit from structured schedules. Use visual timetables to outline daily activities, reducing anxiety from unexpected changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Minimize Sensory Overload</strong>: Given touch and sound sensitivities, avoid crowded places or loud noises. Use noise-canceling headphones or soft clothing to reduce sensory discomfort.</li>
                    <li><strong>Monitor Aggressive Behaviors</strong>: If aggression occurs, identify triggers (e.g., frustration from routine changes) and redirect the child to calming activities like deep breathing or squeezing a stress ball.</li>
                    <li><strong>Encourage Safe Expression</strong>: For echolalia, encourage meaningful communication by modeling simple sentences the child can use instead of repeating phrases.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Therapies to Do at Home</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Social Skills Play</strong>: To improve eye contact and social interaction, engage in turn-taking games like rolling a ball back and forth, gently encouraging eye contact during play.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sensory Integration Activities</strong>: For touch sensitivity, try sensory bins with rice or beans, letting the child explore textures at their own pace.</li>
                    <li><strong>Behavioral Reinforcement</strong>: For repetitive behaviors, introduce alternative activities (e.g., drawing patterns) to redirect the behavior while praising positive engagement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Speech Practice</strong>: To address echolalia, use picture cards to prompt functional speech, such as naming objects or actions, rewarding verbal responses with praise.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="result-title">Explanation & What to Be Aware Of</h3>
                <h5>Explanation</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What We Found</strong>: You said "Yes" to {{ yes_symptoms|join(', ') if yes_symptoms else 'none' }}. This means your child showed some behaviors we checked. Here’s what you told us:
                        <ul>
                            {% for symptom in yes_symptoms %}
                                <li>
                                    {% if symptom == 'eye_contact' %}
                                        Your child has difficulty with eye contact, meaning they might avoid looking at people’s eyes during conversations.
                                    {% elif symptom == 'social_interaction' %}
                                        Your child struggles with social interaction, like finding it hard to join play or talk with others.
                                    {% elif symptom == 'repetitive_behavior' %}
                                        Your child shows repetitive behaviors, such as repeating actions like hand-flapping or lining up toys.
                                    {% elif symptom == 'delayed_speech' %}
                                        Your child has delayed speech, meaning their talking is slower compared to other kids their age.
                                    {% elif symptom == 'echolalia' %}
                                        Your child shows echolalia, which means they repeat words or phrases they hear, like from TV.
                                    {% elif symptom == 'sound_sensitivity' %}
                                        Your child is sensitive to sounds, getting upset by loud noises like vacuums or sirens.
                                    {% elif symptom == 'touch_sensitivity' %}
                                        Your child is sensitive to touch, possibly disliking certain textures or pulling away from hugs.
                                    {% elif symptom == 'emotional_regulation' %}
                                        Your child has difficulty with emotional regulation, meaning they might have frequent meltdowns or trouble calming down.
                                    {% elif symptom == 'change_resistance' %}
                                        Your child resists changes, getting upset when routines or plans are different.
                                    {% elif symptom == 'aggression' %}
                                        Your child shows aggression, such as hitting or throwing things when frustrated.
                                    {% endif %}
                                </li>
                            {% else %}
                                <li>No specific behaviors were noted as "Yes."</li>
                            {% endfor %}
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Image Analysis</strong>: 
                        {% if images %}
                            We analyzed the image you provided to look for additional clues, like signs of distress or specific behaviors. This helped us adjust the overall score.
                        {% else %}
                            No image was provided, so we didn’t analyze any images for this assessment.
                        {% endif %}
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>What It Might Mean</strong>: These behaviors could be early signs of autism, a condition where some kids find social situations or changes tricky. For example, avoiding eye contact might mean they feel more comfortable looking away during talks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Your Child’s Details</strong>: Your child is {{ user_info.age }} years old and {{ user_info.gender }}. Boys are a bit more likely to show these signs (about 4 times more than girls), and age can affect how strong these behaviors seem—older kids like {{ user_info.age }} might show them more as they face bigger social challenges.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not a Final Answer</strong>: This is just a starting point, not a diagnosis. A doctor or specialist needs to check your child properly to be sure.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>What to Be Aware Of</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Keep an Eye on Behaviors</strong>: Watch for {{ yes_symptoms|join(' and ') if yes_symptoms else 'social or emotional signs' }}. If they keep happening, they might need extra help.</li>
                    <li><strong>Track Growth Milestones</strong>: Check if your child is meeting speech or social goals. Delays could be a clue to talk about with a doctor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seek Expert Help</strong>: This score suggests a small chance of autism traits, but only a professional can confirm it after more tests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Support Through Changes</strong>: If your child is older like {{ user_info.age }}, growing up might make some behaviors (like avoiding eye contact) more noticeable—be patient and seek advice if needed.</li>
